# Demo APPs for OpenShift

**Purpose**: This GitOps repository contains multiple DEMO applications that can be used to demonstrate some of the OpenShift capabilities.

The file organization inside the repositories is based on https://github.com/gnunn-gitops/standards/blob/master/folders.md

## Usage

You will find some steps to prepare the demo inside each application folder

## OpenShift version

The repo is prepared to be run with the latest OpenShift version, but you can ajust the operator versions and it should work if you are not too far from the most recent relase.
